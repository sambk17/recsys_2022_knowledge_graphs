# Objective
I am learning about Knowledge Graphs and how this can be cohesively integrated with Recommender Systems (Personalization).  At this year's academic conference RecSys, there is a tutorial on explainable recommender systems using Knowledge Graphs.  The goal is to replicate what I learn in terms of the recent advances on the development and evaluation of explainable recommender systems with knowledge graphs.

# Knowledge Graphs @ RecSys 2022
* ExpRecSys -> [Explainable RecSys](https://explainablerecsys.github.io/recsys2022/)
* KaRS -> [Knowledge-aware and Conversational Recommender Systems](https://kars-workshop.github.io/2022/]

# Prereqs
* ExpRecSys (tutorial)
  * Download the following data sources and store their respective files under /data/{source_name}/ (e.g. source_name=movielens-1m):
    * [MovieLens-1M (ML1M)](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/)
    * [music (LastFM-1B (LASTFM))](www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-1b) # NOTE: It is 8GB
      * Paper outlining how to obtain the data using Python: [PDF Link](http://www.cp.jku.at/people/schedl/Research/Publications/pdf/schedl_icmr_2016.pdf)

* KARS (workshop)
  * none


# Textual explanations using PGPR and CAFE

## What is PGPR?
* Yikun Xian (et al) proposed a method called Policy-Guided Path Reasoning (PGPR)
* This method couples recommendation and interpretability by providing actual paths in a knowledge graph.
* Paper and GitHub source located [HERE](https://github.com/orcax/PGPR)

## What is CAFE?
* Agust√≠n Borrego (et al) proposed a method called Completion using Neighborhood-Aware Features
* CAFE helps generate feature vectors using context-aware features as well as the datasets downloaded in the pre-req
* Paper and GitHub source located [HERE](https://github.com/DEAL-US/CAFE)
